        <h1>Happy 19th Birthday, My Love!</h1>
        <p>
            Today, the world became better because you were born. Youâ€™re not just 19 â€” youâ€™re
            19 candles of beauty, warmth, and light in my life. If I could, Iâ€™d hold your hand,
            kiss your forehead, and tell you how incredibly proud I am to call you mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your smile is the sunshine in my sky, your laugh is the music to my silence,
            and your love is the peace in my chaos. I can't wait for the day we celebrate
            this in person. But until then, this secret page is a little piece of me,
            whispering all the love I feel for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep shining, birthday girl. You are my once-in-a-lifetime, my always, my forever. ðŸ’—
